Can change the 1e10 rule to 1e5 if a problem with that occur

Horisontal axis is real axis
Vertical axis is imaginary axis

the long lines are there for checking the implementation of iterations
the short lines are there for checking the writing to file

computing the square root cost more than not computing it... 10^-3 is euclidean distances

Write this to see the images:   convert "name".ppm "name".png
                                magick "name".ppm "name".png

use fwrite! sprintf - can be used when writing to file

think about the geometry when checking convergence etc

precomputing the roots is a good idea


in multi_stage: 
    v and w - use output as int for number of iterations the other use not necessary float, think about it
    don't need an input just because it is in the script...
    ib and tx - don't need both since they should be the smaller
    mtx and cnd - for syncronisation
    sz and nthrds - need it

clever way of parallelisation - one thread computes the even and one computes the odd values.

communication between writing thread and computing thread. It wants to wait until cimpute haas prolonged enough for it to write to file. - seen in the status variable

thrd_sleep - remove from code because it is only to make code slower
