Can change the 1e10 rule to 1e5 if a problem with that occur

Horisontal axis is real axis
Vertical axis is imaginary axis

the long lines are there for checking the implementation of iterations
the short lines are there for checking the writing to file

computing the square root cost more than not computing it... 10^-3 is euclidean distances

Write this to see the images:   convert "name".ppm "name".png
                                magick "name".ppm "name".png

use fwrite! sprintf - can be used when writing to file

think about the geometry when checking convergence etc

precomputing the roots is a good idea


in multi_stage: 
    v and w - use output as int for number of iterations the other use not necessary float, think about it
    don't need an input just because it is in the script...
    ib and tx - don't need both since they should be the smaller
    mtx and cnd - for syncronisation
    sz and nthrds - need it

clever way of parallelisation - one thread computes the even and one computes the odd values.

communication between writing thread and computing thread. It wants to wait until cimpute haas prolonged enough for it to write to file. - seen in the status variable

thrd_sleep - remove from code because it is only to make code slower

Notes:
 - 10^5 does the job on  second Point regarding Newton iteration.
 - 128 contrary to 50 (shure thing is studpid, but just do as he says!). It still doesn't affect the computation very much.
 - Check "level 3 PPM" on wikipedia.
 - "Use one thread that writes to disc" is actaully quite crucial, use that technique.
 - "Data Transfer", don't use too much memory. Don't 
 - "Writing to file" and "Syncronization" are the two difficult or most important ones.
 - "Data Transfer", he recommend to use global arrays.
 - To find errors in the syncronization, look at the four last Points in syncronization. Similar to two Points directly thereafter "When finishing these steps...".

Thoughts:
 - Last character of a string is a nullterminator, he talks about that this can be used?

Questions:
 - 

Commands/Code-tips:
 - convert newton_Attractors_x7.ppm newton_attractors_x7.png (Used for converting the ppm-file to a png file).
 - magick newton_Attractors_x7.ppm newton_attractors_x7.png (Same as above).
 - Look at the file "multi_stage.c"!!

Extra:
 - Thread pools, Memory pools, look up what these things are!
 - "The mutex is protecting this".
